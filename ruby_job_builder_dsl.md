## Ruby Job Builder DSL

At Wonga we have complex continous integration (CI) systems which we use to build, propogate and release code to our testing and production environments. We employ Jenkins to build SOAP components and run different test suites as part of this CI process. Wonga devops team follows infrastructure as code paradigm, which literally means write code to automate instrastructure tasks. As such we want to write code to create Jenkins jobs instead of using Web UI. 

Initially we used the [Openstack Job Builder](http://ci.openstack.org/jenkins-job-builder/), which allows us to create a Jenkins job configuration in YAML. Maintaining job configuration in YAML is huge step forward in comparsion to using a Web interface, however we soon discovered that YAML also had several limitations. It lacks both composition and abstraction causing tedious repetitive work and maintenance issues. 

This is driving factor for the birth of Ruby Job Builder DSL.

Ruby Jobs Builder DSL is designed as a Ruby internal DSL, so it offers a fully fledged programming experience and at the same time concise, focused vocabularies for job creation. It generates XML job configuration files and deploys those configurations directly on to the designated Jenkins instance. The library is easy to use and has minimal dependencies. 

**Hello World Job**

An example below shows how to create and deploy a simple job.

Step 1 - Create a ruby file e.g. `hello-world.rb` with the following content

    $ cat hello_world.rb
    require 'rubyjobbuilderdsl'
    builder = JenkinsJob::Builder.new
    builder.freestyle 'hello-world' do
      shell 'echo hello world'
    end
    JenkinsJob::Deployer.new(builder).run

Step 2 - Deploy it

    $ cat localhost.ini
    [jenkins]
    url=http://localhost:8080/
    user=jenkins-jobs
    password=7bb352e4f3da683c17247f3abf88f47c

    $ ruby hello_world.rb --deploy --config-file=localhost.ini
    deploying hello-world

Ruby Jobs Builder DSL is extensively used within Wonga. Its DSL supports a handful of plugins that meet the need of different teams. It is used to create anything from simple individual jobs up to the most complex pipeline involving hundreds of jobs.

**Flexibility**

Ruby Jobs Builder DSL quite easy to extend, in Wonga we build other librarys on top of it to provide templates for creation of jobs that are specific to our technology stacks and work workflow. The following example shows how to create a template then subsequently use it for create a job.

    $ cat hello_moon.rb
    require 'rubyjobbuilderdsl'
    builder = JenkinsJob::Builder.new do
      def say(what)
        freestyle "say-#{what}" do
          shell "echo #{what}"
        end
      end
    end

    builder.say 'world'
    builder.say 'moon'
    
    JenkinsJob::Deployer.new(builder).run

Ruby Jobs Builder DSL goes beyond a job's creation, it can delete a job, wipe out the workspace, trigger a build or even run a given groovy script on Jenkins server. This allows us to have a script that not only create jobs but also configure Jenkins as well as perform other administrative activities bringing automation to a new level.

    $ cat hello_mars.rb
    require 'rubyjobbuilderdsl'
    JenkinsJob::Deployer.new.run do
      disable_job 'hello_mars'
      wipeout_workspace 'hello_mars'

      groovysh <<-EOS
        import hudson.tasks.Mailer
        desc = Jenkins.instance.getDescriptorByType(Mailer.DescriptorImpl.class)
        desc.smtpHost = 'mail.mydomain.com'
        desc.defaultSuffix = '@mydomain.com'
        desc.save()
      EOS

      enable_job 'hello_mars'
      trigger_job 'hello_mars'
    end
